    <h2 style="color: white;">Brief Biography</h2>
    <p style="color: bisque;">Hope Babka was born and raised in Sevier County, Tennessee, and is the youngest of three siblings, Zak and Haley, born to Ron and Amanda Babka. 
      Currently living in Seymour, Hope balances a near full-time role at Target, working in the Ulta Beauty department, while actively searching for new opportunities in her field. 
      She earned her esthetics license from the Douglas J. Aveda Institute in Knoxville and is looking forward to beginning her career as a licensed esthetician.
      Hope is known for her caring personality, quick wit, and sometimes stubborn spirit. Though she jokes about being "a big ball of anxiety," her warmth and attention to detail are part of what make her 
      such a special presence to those around her. She's passionate about art in all its forms, whether she's creating it herself or simply enjoying the work of others. Her love for beauty, creativity, and 
      organization gives her a unique perspective that blends structure with imagination.
      Sewing has become one of Hope's favorite hobbies, a passion passed down from her grandmother, who taught her the joy of crafting with a sewing machine. She also loves traveling, being outdoors, and making 
      memories with those she loves. One of her fondest childhood memories is sneaking candy from her grandpa before dinner, one of many sweet moments that continue to inspire her today.
      Though uncertain about what the future holds, Hope remains resilient and grounded by the people who love and support her. She's still writing her story, one thread, one adventure at a time.

  <h2>Interview with Hope</h2>
    <h4 style="color: #85629B; text-align: center;">Recorded on July 7th, 2025</h4>
  <p>To get to know Hope better, here are the questions used to help tell her story:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Can you tell me a little about yourself? Where you’re from, what you do, and something unique about you?</li>
      <em>Hope: I'm from Seymour, TN. I enjoy shopping, and the outdoors, and that's pretty much it. I'm a Target employee, what do you mean what I do? 
        Um, not really much to it, honestly. What's unique about me is that I can't see anything unique about me. Oh! You know what's unique about me? For some
        reason I can pay attention to a lot of details but not the big picture.
      </em>
    <li>How would your friends or family describe you in three words?</li>
      <em>Hope: Stubborn, yeah, I don't know, you ask them. Caring, a little too caring, um, anxious. That would be the best one. I'm a big ole anxiety ball,
        you know?
      </em>
    <li>What’s something you’re passionate about or strongly believe in?</li>
      <em>Hope: Good question. What do I believe in? I am passionate about any types of art I guess? Whether it's enjoying or doing [art]. Also, organization,
        just don't look at my bedroom. Next question. Are you really typing that? [Brennan: Yep].
      </em>
    <li>What’s something you’ve accomplished that you’re really proud of?</li>
      <em>Hope: Uhm, one thing is stopping myself from doing something. It's rated R. That sounds kinda bad. It's to do with mental health and
        therapy. Which my therapist should've retired.
      </em>
    <li>Where do you see yourself in the next few years? Do you have any specific goals or dreams you’re working toward?</li>
      <em>Hope: Hell. It's a joke, don't put that. [Laughing]. Honestly, I'm scared to see myself in the future, it gives me a lot of anxiety.
        I'd prefer it to just be blank.
      </em>
    <li>What do you love to do in your free time?</li>
      <em>Hope: Sleep. Annoy Brennan. Don't listen to this answer because Brennan is the one that's typing it. [Brennan: I'm typing exactly what she says].
        I also have been advancing in my hobbies I have, which is sewing. That's all.
      </em>
    <li>How did you get into that hobby or interest?</li>
      <em>Hope: My grandma, when I was like 5 or 6, um, she used to make pillows and blankets for us. And there was a time where she brought up a sewing machine
        and I thought it was very amusing to see a machine create something like that.
      </em>
    <li>Is there a hobby you want to try but haven’t yet?</li>
      <em>Hope: Bungee jumping. And zip lining. But I think I'll have to be drunk on a few wine bottles. That's all.</em>
    <li>What’s one memory that makes you smile every time you think about it?</li>
      <em>Hope: My grandpa would always, before dinner, would sneak me a piece of candy behind his rocking chair and let me eat it. He would get in trouble,
        since he would only give me candy and no one else. That got me tearin' up.
      </em>
    <li>Who or what inspires you the most in your life, and why?</li>
      <em>Hope: Probably my grandpa. Cause he's so sweet, and he can be so like, the worst person out there and still care for you.
        He still talks to strangers like he has known them for like thirty years.
